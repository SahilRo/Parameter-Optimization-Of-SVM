# Parameter-Optimization-Of-SVM
## Data Set contains 6k rows and 7 columns.
## Data Set is divided into 70-30 training and testing with 10 different samples.
## Then SVM Optimization is done for every sample with 1000 iterations and best parameters are found out.
# BEST KERNEL - rbf
# BEST Nu - 0.2
# BEST EPSILON - 0.1
# BEST ACCURACY - 0.5808871493803001
